- ⏱️ **Session Structure (90--120 min) (Suggested)**

- Here's an ideal structure to maximize learning.

- **1) 10 min --- Full-body skate warm-up**

- Push around

- Quick manuals

- Basic tricks: shove, ollie, fakie ollie, 180

- One small "confidence trick"

- **2) 15 min --- Maintenance Reps**

- Choose 4 tricks you know well\
  → land 3 of each\
  This keeps your "base skill" sharp without exhausting you.

- **3) 30 min --- Deep Focus Block**

- Choose *ONE* target trick per day:

- Flat: FS flip, BS flip, tre flip, bigspin

- Ledge: 50-50 → 5-0, noseslide → nosegrind

- Mini: axle stall → axle to fakie, disaster, tail revert etc.

- Structure:

- 5 min technique observation

- 20 min reps

- 5 min "make it clean + rollback away"

- **Focused practice is where progression actually happens.**

- **4) 20--30 min --- Lines / Park Exploration**

- Build flow and practicality of tricks.

- **5) 10 min --- Cool Down + Strength**

- Small controlled sets of:

- Split squats

- Calf raises

- Ankle mobility

- Hip rotation

- Core (Planks or dead bugs)

- You'll skate longer and safer.

- 

- 🧠 **Skill Progression Framework (IMPORTANT)**

- To progress faster, organize tricks into categories:

- **Tier 1 --- High Consistency (60--90%)**

- Kickflip\
  Shove-it\
  FS/BS 180\
  Ollies (rolling + up curbs)

- Maintain, not overtrain.

- **Tier 2 --- Intermediate (30--50%)**

- Heelflip\
  Fakie flip\
  Variations:

- Half cab flip

- Varial flip

- BS flip (low consistency right now)

- Train 2--3 times per week.

- **Tier 3 --- Low Consistency / Hard Tricks (5--15%)**

- Tre flip\
  Bigspin\
  FS flip\
  Switch flips (early stage)

- Work on ONE per day only.
