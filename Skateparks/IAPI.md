# **🛹 IAPI Skatepark -- Obstacle Guide (Tour Style)**

*Porto Alegre -- RS*

Welcome to **IAPI**, one of Porto Alegre's most iconic street-plaza
skateparks. Think of it as a giant open square filled with
real-spot-inspired obstacles: perfect ground, lines everywhere, and
setups that reward creativity.

Below is a walk-through of the park as if you were entering from the
main side.

## 🔹 1. The Big Flat Plaza (Entry Area)

The first thing you notice is a **huge piece of flat ground** --- fast,
open and perfect for warming up.

**What it's good for:**

- Flat tricks, warmups and long combos

- Pushing at full speed

- Setting up long lines that connect to every obstacle around the park

- Practicing manuals and pivots on the natural micro-slopes

If you like technical warmups or need space to work flow, this is your
zone.

## 🔹 2. Low Ledges & Blocks (Front Section)

Scattered around the front of the plaza are **low granite/concrete
ledges** and **caixotinhos**.

**Skate notes:**

- These are low and forgiving → great for warm-up grinds

- Smooth edges, perfect for crooks, back 50s, front 50s, noseslides

- They are spaced in ways that allow **ledge → flat → ledge** lines

Ideal for:

- New grinds/slides

- Tech lines

- Regular or switch practice

## 🔹 3. Manual Pads

Usually placed near the lower ledges, the manual pads double as low
boxes.

**Use them for:**

- Nose manuals and manuals linking into the next obstacle

- Manual tricks into/off of ledges

- Low, safe flip-in / flip-out attempts

If you love manuals and flat-tech, this is heaven.

## 🔹 4. The Stair Sets (Central Spine)

Running through the middle of the park, you'll find **multiple stair
sets** of different sizes, each with its own personality.

### Small 3--4 Stairs

- Perfect for beginner stair tricks and developing consistency

- Good for warmup ollies, heelflips, 180s

### Medium Sets (5--6 stairs)

- Great for solid street-style tricks

- Often paired with a **hubba** (ledge down the side)

### Large Sets

- Advanced stuff

- Good run-up, long landing

- Real-spot feel

**Tip:** Because the plaza is flat and roomy, you can approach stairs
from many angles, creating different lines.

## 🔹 5. Hubbas & Handrails (Inspired by Downtown POA Spots)

These obstacles imitate well-known city spots.

**Hubbas:**

- Square, stone-like edges running beside the stairs

- Great for:

  - FS/BS 50-50

  - 5-0, 5-0 revert

  - Crooks and noseslides

  - Blunt slides (on the lower ones)

**Handrails:**

- Mostly square or round

- Set at a height good for intermediate--advanced skaters

- Consistent run-up and long enough to lock in safely

Great for:

- Learning basic rail confidence on smaller options

- Full commitment tricks on the bigger ones

## 🔹 6. Flatbars (Central Plaza)

IAPI has multiple low flatbars across the center of the park.

**Why they're good:**

- Perfect height for learning

- You can hit them regular or switch without changing your line

- Wide open run-up and roll-away

- Good for lines, not just single attempts

Perfect for:

- Boardslides, lipslides

- 50-50, 5-0, smiths, feebles

- Tech combos like switch front board to fakie

## 🔹 7. Banks & Wallride Banks

Instead of traditional quarters, IAPI uses banks and straight angled
walls.

### Straight Banks

- Long, mellow angle

- Good for:

  - High-speed tricks

  - Wallies

  - Bank-to-flat tricks

  - Learning tricks with slight angle support

### Wallride-Style Banks

- Steeper, almost vertical in some sections

- Ideal for:

  - Wallrides

  - Reverts

  - Speed checks

  - Catching lines toward central obstacles

## 🔹 8. Bank-to-Ledge / Bank-to-Rail Setups

These are classic street-spot configurations.

**Why they're fun:**

- You enter with speed from the bank

- Hit a ledge or rail at an angle

- Perfect for flowing lines or techy variations

Good for:

- Quick-foot setups

- Angled grinds

- Mixing flip tricks into bank hits into ledges

## 🔹 9. The Transition Corner (Side of the Park)

A small corner includes **quasi-quarters** or steep banks that behave
like transitions.

**What they offer:**

- Quick coping-style hits

- Speed generation

- Hip-style transfers

- Fun change of terrain in a mostly-street park

Transition-heavy skaters can still play here, even though IAPI is mostly
street.

## 🔹 10. The Big Open Line Route (Back Section)

The back of the park is wide open and perfect for creating long lines.

Here you can link:

- Flat ground → ledge → flatbar → bank → stairs → hubba

- Or even go full plaza line for 30--40 seconds straight

Freestyle/creative skaters love this area.
