# **🛹 Orla Skatepark -- Complete Obstacle Tour**

*Porto Alegre -- RS*

Orla is the opposite of IAPI.\
While IAPI feels like a gritty street plaza, Orla feels like a **modern
flow park** with smooth transitions, hips, volcanoes, and creative lines
everywhere --- all with a waterfront vibe.

Think of it as a place where **speed, flow, carving and transition
tricks** naturally happen.

Let's walk through the park from the entrance.

# **🔹 1. Main Bowl (\"o bowl grande\")**

This is the centerpiece of Orla --- a large, modern concrete bowl with
deep and shallow sections.

**Features:**

- Deep end with real vert feel

- Shallow pocket for learning coping work

- Perfectly smooth walls

- Wide hips connecting the pockets

- Metal coping all around

**Good for:**

- Carving at speed

- Airs and floaty frontside/backside grinds

- Carve grinds, 50-50s, smiths

- Spine-transfer-style tricks between pockets

- Pumping lines without ever pushing

If you like transition skating or want to learn it, this bowl is one of
the best in the entire city.

# **🔹 2. Mini-Bowl / Kidney-Shaped Pocket**

Next to the big feature, you'll find a smaller and more playful
bowl/pocket.

**Why it's useful:**

- Easier transitions for beginners

- Safer space to practice grinds before trying them in the big bowl

- Perfect for: rock to fakie, axle stalls, early grab airs, slash grinds

This is an ideal warm-up transition zone.

# **🔹 3. Volcano (Vulcão)**

One of Orla's most iconic features --- a raised, rounded "volcano"
obstacle in the middle of the flow area.

**What you can do here:**

- Manual around the cone

- Blunt variations on the top

- Carving figure-8 lines

- Over-the-top transfers

- Flip tricks onto the platform

It gives that modern "plaza + bowl hybrid" feel.

# **🔹 4. Hips & Roller Transitions**

The flow area has multiple roller-style bumps and hips connecting one
section to another.

**These are perfect for:**

- Generating speed without pushing

- Learning pumping technique

- Transition-based lines

- High-speed grinds on nearby coping sections

- Small wallie-style tricks depending on the angle

Orla is all about *speed* --- and these rollers make it effortless.

# **🔹 5. Long Quarter Pipes (Coastline Quarters)**

Running along the back side, there are long quarter pipes that act like
a "coastline" of transition.

**Great for:**

- Back-and-forth lines

- Building speed into the bowl

- Learning coping tricks in a safe way

- Practicing rock to fakie, slash grinds, and lip tricks

- Wallrides in some angled sections

Ideal for warming up before going into the deeper sections.

# **🔹 6. Street Section (Smaller but Efficient)**

Orla is primarily a flow/transition park, but it *does* include a small
street area.

Expect:

- **Ledges** (low to medium height)

- **Manual pads\**

- **A couple of low rails/flatbars\**

- **Small bank-to-ledge setups\**

This area is flowy and compact --- great for:

- Noseslides, crooks, 50-50s

- Learning switch tricks

- Linking flat + ledge lines

- Manual tricks with lots of runway

If you love street but also want transition, Orla gives you both worlds.

# **🔹 7. Bank-to-Transitions / Creative Angled Walls**

One of Orla's best design elements: quirky angled banks that blend into
transitions.

**Good for:**

- Reverts

- Wallride attempts

- Slide-to-transition combos

- Speed checks before hitting the bowl

- Creative surf-style lines (carve-heavy)

These make Orla a super playful park.

# **🔹 8. Open Flat Area (for Warm-up & Tech)**

A smooth, wide concrete flat zone sits between obstacles.

**Great for:**

- Flatground warmups

- Practicing switch tricks

- Linking transitions with tech

- High-speed pushing between bowls

It's flat, fast, and clean --- perfect for long warmup lines.

# **🔹 9. Riverside Vibe & Flow-Lines**

What makes Orla unique compared to all other parks in POA is **the way
the obstacles connect**.\
You can skate:

- Bowl → volcano → rollers → ledge → quarter

- Roller → hip → bowl pocket → flat → back to quarter

- Quarter → volcano → bank wall → big bowl

Orla feels like a **continuous surf line**.\
Once you get moving, you can skate for 30--50 seconds without ever
pushing.
