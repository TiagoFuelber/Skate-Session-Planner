- Quick manuals on the natural micro-slopes
- Basic tricks sequence:
  - Ollie
  - Pop shovit (BS)
  - Shovit (FS)
  - Frontside 180
  - Backside 180
  - Kickflip
- One small "confidence trick" (heelflip or kickflip)

**Goal:** Get body warm, feel the ground, establish rhythm.

---

### **2) 15 min --- Maintenance Reps**

**Location:** Low Ledges & Blocks (Front Section) + Flat Plaza

Choose 4 tricks you know well → land 3 of each:

1. **Kickflip** (flat plaza)
2. **FS 50-50** (low ledges)
3. **BS noseslide** (low ledges)
4. **BS boardslide** (flatbar)

**Goal:** Keep your base skills sharp without exhausting yourself.

---

### **3) 30 min --- Deep Focus Block**

**Target Trick:** Nollie FS boardslide (Flatbar)

**Location:** Flatbars (Central Plaza)

**Structure:**

- **5 min** - Technique observation
  - Watch your approach angle
  - Focus on nollie pop and frontside rotation
  - Visualize the lock-in point
- **20 min** - Reps
  - Start with nollie ollie onto the flatbar (get comfortable with approach)
  - Attempt nollie FS boardslide
  - Focus on committing to the rotation
  - Land 3-5 clean attempts
- **5 min** - Make it clean + rollback away
  - Focus on landing clean and rolling away smoothly
  - Try to link it into a line (boardslide → manual pad or flat trick)

**Alternative if not feeling it:** Switch to **Nollie 50-50** on low ledges (same structure)

**Goal:** Focused practice is where progression happens.

---

### **4) 40 min --- Lines / Park Exploration**

**Location:** Throughout IAPI - Use the Big Open Line Route

**Option A - Technical Line (Front Section):**

- Flat trick → Low ledge (50-50 or noseslide) → Manual pad → Flat trick → Small stair set

**Option B - Flatbar Line (Central Plaza):**

- Approach from bank → Flatbar (boardslide or 50-50) → Roll to flat → Kickflip or heelflip → Manual pad

**Option C - Stair Set Line (Central Spine):**

- Warm-up ollie down small 3-4 stair
- Build up to kickflip or heelflip down medium set (5-6 stairs)
- Link with hubba grind/slide if feeling confident

**Option D - Bank-to-Ledge Setup:**

- Use the bank-to-ledge configurations
- Enter with speed from bank → Hit ledge at angle → Roll away
- Try: Bank → BS noseslide → Roll away

**Option E - Nollie Practice Line:**

- Nollie FS 180 (flat) → Nollie 50-50 (low ledge) → Manual pad → Nollie pop rock (if near transition corner)

**Goal:** Build flow and practicality of tricks. Try 2-3 different line variations.

---

### **5) 20 min --- Secondary Focus / Weak Trick Work**

**Location:** Flat Plaza or Low Ledges

Choose ONE from your weak tricks list:

- **BS 50-50** (ledge) - if you want to work on regular stance
- **FS boardslide** (flatbar) - regular stance
- **360 BS shovit** (flat) - if you want flatground work
- Or continue working on **nollie tricks** if the deep focus block went well

**Structure:**

- 5 min observation/visualization
- 15 min reps (don't overdo it - you're 90 minutes in)

---

### **6) 5 min --- Cool Down + Strength**

**Location:** Anywhere in the park (or off to the side)

Small controlled sets:

- Split squats (10 each leg)
- Calf raises (15 reps)
- Ankle mobility circles (10 each direction)
- Hip rotation stretches
- Core - Plank (30-45 seconds) or dead bugs (10 reps)

**Goal:** You'll skate longer and safer.
