# **🛹 Realistic Ledge Trick Learning Order (Regular Stance Only)**

*(from easiest → hardest)*

## 1 --- Foundations (must-learn basics)

These teach approach, weight distribution, and lock-ins.

- Ollie onto/off a ledge (ollie up / ollie down)

- 50-50 grind

- 5-0 grind

- 5-0 stall

- Nose stall

- Tail stall

## 2 --- Entry-Level Slides (learning balance & wax control)

- Boardslide (on a low ledge)

- Lipslide

- Noseslide

- Tailslide

*(Noseslide is usually first slide, then boardslide or tailslide
depending on comfort.)*

## 3 --- Core Ledge Tricks (the \"street skating essentials\")

These are the backbone of modern ledge skating.

- Nosegrind

- Smith grind

- Feeble grind (on a low, easy ledge)

- Suski grind (5-0 with lifted nose)

- Crooked grind (crook)

- Overcrook

Crook and nosegrind are huge milestones.

- Noseslide shove-out

- Noseslide 270 shove-out

- Tailslide shove-out

- 50-50 180 out

- 5-0 180 out

- Nosegrind 180 out
